This project was build as part of our final grade for programming semester 2. The specifications for the project were as follows:
1. Generate a puzzle from either user specified words or random words from a file where the user specifies the smallest and largest posible word as well as the amount of words.
2. Create a grid big enough to fit all the words aswell as hide them.
3. Randomly place each word on the grid either horizontal (left to right or right to left) or veritcal (top to bottom or bottom to top). Making sure there is both room for the word and that it doesnt overwrite another word already placed.
4. Fill the grid with random letters.
5. Show the list of words chosen.
6. If the user types false for boolean hide show the location of each word by having the coordinates and direction next to the word. If the user types true dont show the location.
